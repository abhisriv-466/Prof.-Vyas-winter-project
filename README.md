# Prof.-Vyas-winter-project
In this project, we have developed graphical user interface using tkinter, to help users directly choose their parameters, to build and train a CNN-based machine learning model.
This project aims at reducing the amount of code-work for developing an ML model.
This scope of this project can be expanded to different type of ML models and purposes. Currently, it is being used to identify fault classes in Rotor-based machinery.
